# MovieFinder
MovieFinder is an Android App that can locate and display local movie theatres on a map using the Google Maps API. It displays a listing of current movies and their show times. You can also directly input a zip code to see the movie theatres in that area, if you do not wish to view local ones. This app uses the OnConnect API by Gracenote (http://developer.tmsapi.com/) to obtain updated movie theatre info in a JSON format.
